# Discussion
In the following section are some discussion exercises. 

a) The term "fuzz" was introduced by Barton Miller in 1988,
but the idea of giving random input to a program was not new at that time.
It is still only used to a limited extent today, but have gained more popularity recently.
**Why do you think, it just started to gain more popularity recently?**

b) Fuzz testing resemblance unit test to a high degree.
In fact, some would say that it is the same or that fuzz testing is simply automated unit tests.
**Discuss whether you think fuzz test is just an automated unit test or if they differ and how?**

c) The exercises today have focused on running fuzz tests using AFL++, 
where each exercise was tailored to include some fuzzable error.
**How relevant do you find fuzz testing in general and for your current or future career?**

d) When testing an application, the box-methodology is often used. 
We already learned a bit about how the different types affect a fuzzers precision and efficiency.
**If you where lead QA on a huge project, and you decided to use fuzz testing to test your system,
which of the three _boxes_ would you choose to work with and why?**
- What if you where a small company with limited recourses?
- What if you were not directly affiliated with the project but an external tester?

e) It is no secret that testing is used everywhere to secure applications and systems.
**Can you test a system/application to be secure?**
- In theory and in practice?
- Is there some other way we can **ensure** security? (maybe even _prove_ it)
