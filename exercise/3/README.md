# Discussion and Reflection
In the following section are some exercises, that  

a) The term "fuzz" was introduced by Barton Miller in 1988, but ofcourse the idea of giving random input to a program was not new at that time. It is still only used to a limited extent today, but have gained more popularity recently, **Why do you think, it just started to gain more popularity recently?**

b) Fuzz testing resemblance unit test to a high degree. In fact some would say that it is the same or that fuzz testing is simply automated unit tests. **Discuss whether you think fuzz test is just automated unit test or if they differ how?**

c) The exercises today have focused on running fuzz tests using AFL++, where each exercise was tailored to include some fuzzable error. **How relevant do you find fuzz testing for your current or future career?**
