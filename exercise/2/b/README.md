This is the 2nd exercise using the instrumentation supplied by AFL++, 
you can run and compile the application following the small tutorial in the parent directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------

### Understanding the application
The application seems familiar and is rather simple. 
Describe the application (a single sentence should suffice).

### Understanding the Results


- **Looking at the source code and results of the fuzz test, can you determine the cause of the crash?**
- **What length does a testcase need to have to trigger the crash?**
- **Fix the application!**
