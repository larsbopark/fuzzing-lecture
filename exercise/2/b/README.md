If you are doing the exercises chronologically, and you have looked in the source code you will probably recognise it from exercise 1/d. If you have not done so i recommend you to do exercise 1/d before continuing with this exercise. Before you are able to start fuzz testing you need to generate a testcase, you should use the one from 1/d to proper compare the two tests.

### Notice the difference
We should experience that the first crash is found faster than doing the blackbox, it ofcourse depends much on the testcase(s).
