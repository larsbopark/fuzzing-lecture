# Fuzz Testing Exercises
This repository is made as an supplement to the fuzz testing lectures held by Lars Bo Frydenskov, Research Assistant on Aalborg University. 

## Running Docker
Simply be sure to have Docker installed, and then run the build script.
```bash
./build-docker.sh
```
Then a container is spawned with a terminal to interact with the container. The image used is pulled from `aflplusplus/afplusplus` from the Docker Hub. For more information take a look at [AFL++ github repository](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus).
